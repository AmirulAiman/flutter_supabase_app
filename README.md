# flutter_supabase_app

Flutter ToDo App with Supabase as the backend.

## Getting Started

1. Create Supabase database account and create the `my_todos` table.
The table is defined as follow.
```
create table
  public.my_todos (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    task character varying null,
    is_completed boolean null default false,
    constraint my_todos_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```
2. Copy the file `env.supabase.dart` to `supabase.dart` fill the following variable:
```
    final supabaseURL="Fill your own supabase url"
    final supabaseAnonKey="Fill your own supabase anon-key"
```
url and anonKey can be found in [Project Settings>API]() of your supabase account.

3. Run ```flutter run```
